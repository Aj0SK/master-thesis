In the first chapter, we look more closely at the goals of succinct data structures.
We describe scenarios when they are very competitive but we also discuss their drawbacks.
We also show useful applications of succinct data structures and demonstrate that the bit
vector is an essential building block when implementing these structures.

In the second chapter, we show various implementations of methods $\rank$ and $\select$.
We discuss what are the theoretically optimal solutions but also what are their practical
alternatives. We then proceed to describe one of the widely used implementations of the
compressed bit vector.

In the third chapter, we propose our own modifications to the implementation of compressed bit
vector proposed in the previous chapter. We discuss more theoretical aspects of these modifications.

In the fourth chapter, we propose implementation of methods previously devised and then experimentally
test and evaluate them. We measure the performance of our solution on artificial but also real-world
data. We demonstrate how our idea can be used to get a better ratio of speed and space used by FM-index.
